# Dot-Phrases
"Dot Phrases" is a program that allows for a chunk of text to be automatically typed when the user types a period followed by a short user created phrase. For example, you can set .email to generate "email@example.com" saving you valuable typing time. This is useful for saving typing time when you utilize the same phrases repeatedly.
